# Human-in-the-Loop Gate

Pause execution at decision boundaries where human judgment is required.
Present the context, options, and recommendation, then wait for explicit
user approval before proceeding.

---

## Triggers

Use this skill when:
- "pause for user approval"
- "human-in-the-loop"
- "require user confirmation"
- "ask before proceeding"
- "high-impact decision gate"
- "safety check needed"
- "confirm this action before execution"
- "interrupt for user decision"

Do NOT use for routine decisions that clearly fall within the agent's
authority, or when the user has explicitly granted blanket approval for
a category of actions.

---

## Process

### Phase 0: Gate Classification

When a decision point is reached, classify the gate type immediately:

| Gate Class | Signal | Example | Action |
|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| **AMBIGUITY** | Unclear intent, multiple valid interpretations | "Do you want to refactor the entire module or just one function?" | Present options with trade-offs |
| **SAFETY** | Destructive operation, data loss, irreversible change | "Delete 50 files matching pattern" | Require explicit approval |
| **HIGH-IMPACT** | Significant cost, time, scope, or external effect | "Deploy to production" or "Spend $500 on API credits" | Require explicit approval with impact summary |
| **PERMISSION** | External action, credential use, data sharing | "Email this report to client@example.com" | Require confirmation of recipients and content |
| **AUTHORITY** | Decision outside stated scope or policy | "Override the security policy configured in project settings" | Escalate — require explicit override |
| **CONFIRMATION** | User asked a question back to the agent | (Any user query that expects a decision) | Gate is automatically satisfied when user responds |

---

### Phase 1: Build Gate Presentation

For each gate, construct a structured presentation:

```markdown
## ⏸ Gate: <class>

**Operation:** <what is about to happen>

**Context:**
- <relevant facts, inputs, state>
- <why this gate was triggered>

**Risk assessment:**
- **Impact:** <high / medium / low — what's at stake>
- **Reversibility:** <reversible / partially reversible / irreversible>
- **Cost:** <monetary, time, or resource estimate if applicable>

**Options:**
1. **Proceed** — <what happens, any conditions>
2. **Modify** — <suggested adjustment, if appropriate>
3. **Abort** — <stop and return to previous state>
4. <any additional options>

**Recommendation:** <option #, with rationale>

**Awaiting your decision...**
```

**Gate presentation rules:**
1. State the operation in plain language — no jargon
2. Quantify impact when possible ("will delete 12 files", "will cost ~$0.50")
3. Always include the "recommendation" — the agent should have an opinion
4. Include an "abort" option that restores prior state or stops cleanly
5. Never present a false choice (e.g., "proceed or abort" when both do the same thing)

---

### Phase 2: Present Gate to User

Output the gate presentation and pause:

```markdown
**Gate active:** Waiting for user input before proceeding.

The task is paused at this decision point. Once you respond, execution
will continue based on your choice.
```

**Pause behavior:**
- Do NOT take further actions until user responds
- Do NOT make assumptions about the user's choice
- If the user's response is ambiguous, clarify before proceeding
- If the user asks a question about the options, answer and re-present the gate

---

### Phase 3: Process User Decision

When the user responds:

```markdown
## Gate Resolved

**User decision:** <proceed / modify / abort / custom>
**User input:** <verbatim response>

**Action taken:**
- <what happens next>

**Gate log:**
| Gate | Class | Decision | Time |
|------|-------|----------|------|
| <operation> | <class> | <decision> | <timestamp> |
```

**Decision handling:**

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "Proceed" / "Yes" / "Go ahead" | Execute the operation as presented |
| "Modify" / "Change X" | Apply the modification, re-present gate if scope changes significantly |
| "Abort" / "No" / "Stop" | Abort the operation, return to prior state |
| "Let me think..." / "What does X mean?" | Answer the question, re-present the gate |
| Ambiguous / unclear | Ask for clarification: "I understood <X>. Is that correct?" |

**After resolution:**
- Log the decision to the gate log
- If proceeding: execute the operation
- If aborting: execute any cleanup / rollback
- If modifying: adjust parameters and either execute directly (low-risk) or re-gate (if modification changes risk profile)

---

### Phase 4: Gate Logging

Maintain a running log of all gates triggered during a session:

```markdown
## Gate Log

| # | Timestamp | Operation | Class | Decision | Duration |
|---|-----------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | 12:00:00 | Delete temp files | SAFETY | Proceed | 5s |
| 2 | 12:05:00 | Email draft to client | PERMISSION | Modify | 30s |
| 3 | 12:10:00 | Refactor auth module | AMBIGUITY | Abort | 15s |
```

**Gate log rules:**
- Record every gate, regardless of outcome
- Include the time between gate presentation and resolution
- If gates are too frequent (> 3 in a session), flag to the user:
  "Gates triggered N times. Would you like to adjust the gate sensitivity?"

---

### Phase 5: Gate Sensitivity Adjustment

If the user expresses frustration with too many (or too few) gates:

```markdown
## Gate Sensitivity Settings

**Current sensitivity:** <normal / high / low>

**Adjustment options:**
1. **High sensitivity** — Gate on AMBIGUITY, SAFETY, HIGH-IMPACT, PERMISSION, AUTHORITY (default)
2. **Normal sensitivity** — Gate on SAFETY, HIGH-IMPACT, AUTHORITY only
3. **Low sensitivity** — Gate on SAFETY and AUTHORITY only
4. **Custom** — Define specific gate classes or operations to always/never gate

**How to change:**
- "Set gate sensitivity to low"
- "Never gate on file deletions under 10 files"
- "Always gate on any deployment operation"
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Instead |
|-------|---------|
| Gating trivial decisions (analysis paralysis) | Only gate when impact, ambiguity, or risk is substantial |
| Presenting options without a recommendation | Always recommend a specific course of action |
| Making the user read a wall of text | Keep gate presentations concise and scannable |
| Proceeding without waiting for a response | Truly pause — no actions until user input |
| Re-gating the same operation multiple times | If the user said "proceed", proceed without re-gating |
| Gate on every tool call | Gate on decision boundaries, not individual operations |
| Assuming user intent from partial input | Wait for a clear, unambiguous response |

## Execution Checklist

```
[ ] Phase 0: Gate classified (AMBIGUITY / SAFETY / HIGH-IMPACT / PERMISSION / AUTHORITY / CONFIRMATION)
[ ] Phase 1: Gate presentation built (operation, context, risk, options, recommendation)
[ ] Phase 2: Gate presented to user, execution paused
[ ] Phase 3: User decision received and processed
[ ] Phase 3: Decision logged in gate log
[ ] Phase 4: Gate log maintained for the session
[ ] Phase 5: Sensitivity adjusted if user feedback indicates
[ ] Verify: No actions were taken before user responded
[ ] Verify: Gate presentation includes all 5 elements (operation, context, risk, options, recommendation)
[ ] Verify: Abort option always present and includes cleanup/rollback
```

---

## Verification

After gate execution:
1. No action was taken before the user responded to the gate
2. Gate presentation included: operation, context, risk assessment, options, and recommendation
3. The user's decision was correctly interpreted and executed
4. Gate log captures: operation, class, decision, and duration
5. Abort path cleanly restores prior state
6. Gate sensitivity is appropriate for the session (not too many, not too few)
